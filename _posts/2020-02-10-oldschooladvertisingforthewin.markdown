		This fall, we were on a roadtrip to San Antonio, Texas.   I started seeing billboards with pictures of peoples' faces and their former career, under the job title it said intriguing employment positions, like computer programmer, data scientist, and software engineer.  Little did I know, my family was moving 4 hours south to Bexar County and I would be in the market for a new job.  Riding down I-35 South, I remember looking out at the road ahead, knowing we would eventually arrive at our intended destination but  I had no idea what the road ahead actually looked like. 
		 I noticed many of the billboards showed people who were working in vocations similar to me and apparently had taken the leap to go to coding bootcamp and change their lives.  This caused me to start researching the idea of software development and the projected need for jobs going forward.  It was important to me to be able to secure employment once the training was complete. I wanted to avoid any field that was experiencing market saturation.  Once I checked out the job forecast on the Department of Labor and Statistics website, I was pleased to know there is a high demand for talent in the field of software engineering.  
		 Because I do not have a degree, it was important to me to find a career path that would help me meet my financial goals.  I am so pleased that a 4 year degree was not required.  Once I found that out, I began to research more.  I believe my ability to calmly problem solve and think of creative solutions makes this a suitable choice for me to pursue.  I did find out about Flatiron School through a series of great advertisements when I was playing card games online.  Because of this new found information and the research I did online, this school was the first name I checked into after I made the decision to go online and complete my certification.
